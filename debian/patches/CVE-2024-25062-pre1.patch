Subject: [PATCH] Avoid call stack overflow with XML reader and recursive
 XIncludes

Don't process XIncludes in the result of another inclusion to avoid
infinite recursion resulting in a call stack overflow.

This is something the XInclude engine shouldn't allow but correct
handling of intra-document includes would require major changes.
